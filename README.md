# Shopping Cart - React & TS

The project is an online store simulation that allows users to browse and purchase products. It is built using **React and TypeScript**, leveraging the power of **hooks** and the **useContext** API for state management. The shopping cart functionality is implemented using **local storage** to persist the cart data across sessions. The project also utilizes **Bootstrap** for responsive and visually appealing UI components. 
With this project, users can add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and remove items. It provides a seamless and intuitive shopping experience, showcasing the capabilities of React and TypeScript in building interactive web applications.
